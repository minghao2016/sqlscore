# Standardized coefficient extraction
#
# Extract model coefficients in a standardized format (as a named numeric vector).
#
# @section Warning:
# The Binomial models in glmboost return coefficients which are 1/2 the coefficients
# fit by a call to glm(..., family=binomial(...)), because the response variable is
# internally recoded to -1 and +1. sqlscore multiplies the returned coefficients by 2
# to put them back on the same scale as glm, and adds the glmboost offset to the
# intercept before multiplying.
#
# @param object An object for which the extraction of model coefficients is meaningful.
#
# @return Model coefficients as a named numeric vector.
